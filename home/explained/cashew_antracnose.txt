Anthracnose:
	Description:
		Is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants, including trees, shrubs, and crops. Anthracnose typically appears as dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. These lesions may also have a distinctive margin between healthy and infected tissue. anthracnose is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days. The fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85ËšF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.


	Symptoms:
		Symptoms of anthracnose can vary depending on the host plant and environmental conditions, but common signs include leaf curling, wilting, defoliation, and premature fruit drop. In severe cases, anthracnose can cause significant damage to plant health and yield.


	Treatment:
		a) Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.

		b) If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.

		c) To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.

		d) Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.

		e) Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.

		f) Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.

		g) Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants. Apply early, at the first sign of spring budding, every 7-14 days as a preventative measure or on a 7-day schedule until existing problems are eliminated.


	Management strategies:

		Management strategies for anthracnose often involve cultural practices such as sanitation (removing and destroying infected plant debris), promoting good air circulation, avoiding overhead irrigation, and planting resistant varieties when available. Fungicides may also be used in severe cases, although they are typically more effective as preventative measures rather than curative treatments.

	Note: - For specific information on managing anthracnose in particular plants or crops, it's best to consult local agricultural extension services or gardening resources, as control methods can vary depending on the species affected and the region.
